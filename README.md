Dear User,

May we welcome you to our humble website with a great mission in our minds! We are the creators of consoul.log - the place where you can unload your mind clutter and place it on display for sake of your private reflections. Even if you are not a technologist and it just happens that you have stumbled upon this page in your random search for reconciliation on the net, you are more than welcome. Division of humans into castes is not our mission!

Read on, our valuable visitor, and you will find truth in this document that hopefully will help you to use our journal effectively! Withous further ado, let's see us getting started.
