## Client

Dear User,

May we welcome you to our humble website with a great mission in our minds! We are the creators of consoul.log - the place where you can unload your mind clutter and place it on display for sake of your private reflections. Even if you are not a technologist and it just happens that you have stumbled upon this page in your random search for reconciliation on the net, you are more than welcome. Division of humans into castes is not our mission!

But what is ... ?

Read on, our valuable visitor, and you will find truth in this document that hopefully will help you to use our journal effectively! Withous further ado, let's see us getting started.

## Installation and using the website
 
 ### Using Netlify deployed link
 <link></link>
 
 ### Without using the deployed website
 1. Clone or download the repos to the same folder from theduckfliesagain/all-about-the-journal and the duckfliesagain/journal-server.
 2. Run npm install in both directories (this installs dependencies).
 3. cd into all-about-the-journal folder and start the server using npm run dev (starts server using watchify bundler).
 4. cd .. to go back and cd into journal-server folder. Here we need to start our server running npm start command.
 5. Cool! Now head to http://localhost:8000/! Happy journaling.

## Technologies

 1. Giphy API
 2. Express API framework
 3. Nodemon server runner
 4. Jest testing 
 5. Packery (website layouts) 

## Process

The team has followed linear design approach that is 
 1) we have gathered initially to discuss and brainstorm ideas:
    - brainstorming took place on Moqups online platform for collaborative website wireframing.
 2) we have agreed on the layout and proceeded onto determining the main milestones of the project to tackle:
    - here we used Kanban board in GitHub projects with some automation on some of the boards
    - must-haves of our website and other features were organised using MoSCow method
 3) we have split the work into pairs matching partners by their abilities to ensure everyone learns from experience
 4) we have considered political, social and technological factors before proceeding with the design
    - for example, user persona and technologies to aid creationg had to be determined
